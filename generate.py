# Length, unary constraints (not ac3)
# Initialization phase where Domain for each variable are first established
# Handle before ac3() 

# Positional constraints (is ac3): 
    # part of initial puzzle setup and remain constant. 
    # IF the postnl constrnt is bcs of intersection 
    # w another word its binary (and part of ac3)

# Intersection constraints (is ac3):
    # where 2 variables intersect / cross each other
    # inherent to the structure of the crossword puzzle
    # remain constant throughout the program's run
    # dictates that for interscting words the letter at that point must be the same
    # Crucial to the ac3() function

# Least Constraining Value / Minimum Constraing Value - used during backtracking search
